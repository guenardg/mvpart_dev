\title{Tree-Clustering Comparison}
\usage{
trclcomp(x, method = "com", km = TRUE, mrt = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Rpart object with method "mrt" -- see \code{\link{rpart}}.}

\item{method}{The clustering method for the unconstrained clustering.}

\item{km}{If \code{TRUE} a K-Means clustering is compared with the
multivariate tree partitioning.}

\item{mrt}{If \code{TRUE} an additional K-Means clustering with a starting
configuration based on the multivariate tree partitioning is generated.}
}
\value{
Returns a list (invisibly) of the within-tree and within-cluster
variation for all tree sizes.
}
\description{
This function compares the within-group variation for groups formed by tree
partitioning and unconstrained clustering. The results are plotted and
returned invisibly.
}
\details{
The within-group variation for groups formed by multivariate tree
partitioning and unconstrained clusterings are compared for all sizes of the
hierarchy of tree partitions.
